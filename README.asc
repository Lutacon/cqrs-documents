= CQRS Documents by Greg Young

https://twitter.com/gregyoung[Greg Young] created a https://cqrs.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/cqrs_documents.pdf[fantastic PDF document on CQRS] that has been around the internet for quite some time.

PDF documents don't not work well on mobile or tablet devices and they are hard to modify and sync. I thought it was a good idea to port the documents into an ebook, here is the result of it.

I didn't change the original content of the document, all credit goes to Greg.
